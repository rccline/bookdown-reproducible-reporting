  abstract = {The importance of reproducibility, replication, and transparency in the research endeavor is increasingly discussed in academia. This workshop will introduce the concept of “reproducibility” and foundational strategies that can increase the reproducibility of your work particularly related to organization, documentation, literate coding techniques, version control, and archiving data and code for future access and use. We will also present a protocol, the TIER protocol, as a tool that graduate students or others can use that are first approaching reproducibility.
